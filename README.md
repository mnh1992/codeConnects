## Welcome to code-connects!

To get started from your command line:

-  Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/mindip/codeConnects.git
-  cd code-connects
-  npm install
-  npm start

This will likely fail unless you have done the following:

1. install npm
2. Download/Install Mongodb
3. create/connect to a database called codeconnects

If you are backend and find that you're unfamiliar with any of the technologies in the stack,
please look up some tutorials and read documentation for them (mongodb, express, node).
If you are part of the front end team, look to Andy for more specific direction on what
you should be learning.

Good Luck and Welcome to the Team~
